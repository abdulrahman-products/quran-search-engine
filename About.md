# Why

the current state of search in Quran apps is not enabling the reader to have the basic search capabilities that they are used to have in everyday with modern search engine like google (e.g. when search for “كهق” you expect the search engine to give the result for “كهف”)

We want to give all muslims the ability to have a high quality and fast search engine for Quran.
